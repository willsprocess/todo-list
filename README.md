Brian did an awesome job explaining how to create this Todo List App highly recommend subscribing to his channel for awesome guides like this one.

## The Goal
The goal here isn't to be a rockstar coder. I was struggling looking at the giant mefiforical mountian i needed to clime in the process of re-learning how to code. I deceided to tackle this issue the same way I clean my room when im scratching my head when needing to clean my room... Just start. It doesnt matter that I'm following tutorials step by step. I'm re-entering the world of code again.

## What I gained from this first project
I learned so many different lessons from this project like when things arent working and I am getting frustrated to remember to step away for a while come back with a new set of eyes you'd be surprised how easily you over looked some part of the tutorial causing you to get errors in your code. I also found myself looking back to fundementals like what's the difference between var, let, & const. Taking notes along the way and googling the diffrences between functional components and class components.

### *SIDE NOTE:* Having friends who are more experianced in this field is a huge plus being able to have a 30 min run down of basic concepts or just having someone to go to for help is invaluable.

### Nothing like the smile on my face when the project was done now I remeber why I like to code. :)
