# Creating 7 beginner projects:

I got this idea from a blog post: https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/web-development/react-js-projects-for-beginners

## Video Tutorial Followed for this project is:

Brian did an awesome job explaining how to create this Todo List App highly recommend subscribing to his channel for awesome guides like this one.

## The Goal
The goal here isn't to be a rockstar coder. I was struggling to look at the giant metaphorical Mountian I needed to clime in the process of re-learning how to code. I decided to tackle this issue the same way I clean my room when I'm scratching my head when needing to clean my room... Just start. It doesn't matter that I'm following tutorials step by step. I'm re-entering the world of code again.

## What I gained from this first project
I learned so many different lessons from this project. When things aren't working and I am getting frustrated remember to step away for a while and come back with a new set of eyes you'd be surprised how easily you overlooked some part of the tutorial causing you to get errors in your code. I also found myself looking back to fundamentals like what's the difference between var, let, & const. Taking notes along the way and googling the differences between functional components and class components.

### *SIDE NOTE:* 
Having friends who are more experienced in this field is a huge plus being able to have a 30 min run down of basic concepts or just having someone to go to for help is invaluable.

*Nothing like the smile on my face when the project was done now I remeber why I like to code. :)*
